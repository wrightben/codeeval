## Description:

A number is a self-describing number when (assuming digit positions are labeled 0 to N-1), the digit in each position is equal to the number of times that that digit appears in the number.

**Input sample:**

The first argument is the pathname to a file which contains test data, one test case per line. Each line contains a positive integer. Each line is in the format: N i.e. a positive integer eg.

> 2020<br />22<br />1210<br >

**Output sample:**

If the number is a self-describing number, print out a 1. If not, print out a 0 eg.

> 1<br/>0<br/>1

For the curious, hereâ€™s how 2020 is a self-describing number: **orderedHash**{ *"0"*:2, *"1"*:0, *"2"*:2, *"3"*:0 }
